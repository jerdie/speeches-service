# Speeches Service
A politician will give many speeches in their political career. Many politicians
currently draft their speeches in an ad-hoc fashion using Microsoft Word and
share versions with their team using email. This process is inefficient as it does not
allow for the users to centrally store, archive, and search their speeches.

This service does the following:
1. View all their speeches saved in the system.

2. Add a speech to the system (for this challenge we will consider a speech to
   have the actual text, the author information, keywords about the speech
   and a speech date).
3. Edit a speech or its metadata
4. Delete a speech
5. The ability to search the speeches â€“ (search by author, date range, subject
   area, or snippets of text from the speech body.
